Window Utility Function
JS is synchronus Function, In the the problem is if one line is not executed the following will also not executed.
For this problem we use solution as => Timing Events. (Make JS to Synchronus to nonSynchronus)

There are 2 main methods we use in window utility method :
setTimeout, setInterval

setTimeout:
It will be implemented or executed after specific time.
It will be executed only once.
ArIthmetic also can be performed in setTimeout.
To stop setTimeout we can use: clearTimeout.

Syntax:
setTimeout(function,milliseconds)

.SMALL HINT :
var conunter = document.getElementById('counter')
 if(i==10){
        setTimeout(() => {
     ## console.log("Happy Independence Day")        => It will print output in the console page
     ## conter.innerText="Happy Independence Day"    => It will print output in the document page
        },1000)

setInterval:
We can call a same function again and again after certain interval it is called setInterval.

Syntax:
setInterval(function,millisecond)
