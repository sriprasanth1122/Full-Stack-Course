Async programming Day1 - Callback

JavaScript always give preference to first comes first. Prefer who take less time.
   
JavaScript is a synchronous function (Line by line execution) so this consume more memory and time.
So for the Advance JavaScript is founded.

Advance JS : 
It is to make Synchronuous to async... function

.Callback (1st invention of advance JS) => Real time use => DS & Algo____________________
It is a function which take one or more function as a parameter.
SetTimeout is an exapmle for classback function.

SetTimeout is an example of async function
It take function as a parameter
As well as the  amount of time need to block the code.

Why callback is needed? => Now used in NodeJS (Backend)
To avoid time consuming and memory waste. 

Step by step execution of callback function:________________

 callstack : It is a place in a browser where it keeps track of the function(all codes) that has to be called in the program.
             It has all the callback function indside it. Then it send it to webapi

 webapi : It holds the callback function according to its time and send it to the callbackqueue

 callbackqueue : It handle the callback function which is need to be executed.

 eventloop : This send the function from callbackqueue to the callstack in needed times.

 These four elements are elements which execute the functions like SetTimeout.


Pain of Callback (Disadvantages of Callback)______________________________________________________________________________________________________________

Callback Hell: (Multiple function inside a function)
It is a function consist os function inside a function and function inside a function if continuoes it is called callback function.
It is known as the pain of callback, It means it is the disadvantage of the callback.
