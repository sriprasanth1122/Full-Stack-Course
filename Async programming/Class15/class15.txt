
Promise ___________________________
It is to over come the disadvantages in the Callback.

What is a promise ?
A promise is a JavaScript object that links producing code and consuming code.
It is an objectwhich holds the result of async operation.

Inside the promise it always takes function as a parameter.
 The function it has 2 parameters
 .Resolve
 .Reject

There are some states in Promise, They are
 .Pending
 .Resolve / Fulfilled
 .Reject 

Syntax: 
var variable name = new Ppromise ( () => { } );
(Here new is an inbuild keyword, in OPP javascript)

We cannot use resolve reject at the same time, if used then the output will be pending.
When the result is got rejected it will always show a error msg with the result.

When we dont want to get the error msg allong with the rejected state we want to handle the function.
To handle the Promise we use => .then and .catch
.then => for Success => Resolved
.catch => for Failure => Rejected
As a developer you need to use both .then and .catch in a function.

when ever we are using promise wiyhout error handling messages, SetTimeout will not work inside the function.

Dependent operation, Promise chain __________________________________________

Result got from an 1 fn is an input of the next function is called dependent function.
This process occurs again and again is called promise Chain.

Promise.all & Promise.allsettled____________________________________

If you are using multiple promises there are more number of .then .catch needed
Which is a time consuming process and chances of syntax is high.
To over come this drawback we got promise.all method
It will return all function at the same time eventhough we using SetTimeout.

Major Drawback: (It hides the resolved statu)
Promise.all will always returns the rejected function. It returns resloved when all the elements are true in a function. Eventhough some function are get fulfiled.

To over come this => Promise.allsettled is founded.
Promise.allsettled: 
It shows all the outputs, no matter it is resolved or rejected.
It shows status of all function.
