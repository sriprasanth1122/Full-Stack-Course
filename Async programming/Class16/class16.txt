There are 4 pillars of advance JavaScript
1. Callback
2. Promise
3. Fetch
4. Async / Await

Fetch___________________________

What is Fetch ?
To get data from an API.

Old method is XMLHttpRequest => Used for client server communition.
Request, Open, Send, Onload => Four steps. It is a time consuming process.
To over come the drawback Fetch is introduced.
Fetch is alternate method for XMLHttpRequest.

Syntax: fetch("api url)

Fetch always returns the Promise
Inside the promise inside the body the datas are in readable stream formate.
We cannotdo anything with this. So we need a data format output.
For this we need to change into JSON format by using .json method.
Befor that we have to handle thos fetch.(.then 2 times)

(1:50:00)
MockAPI => CRUD => Create Read Update Delete. (NOTE: In HTTP methods it is => Get Put Post Delete)

Async / Await_________________________________

It is analternative for fetch => Syntatcic Sugar: Easiest way to write a code.
It also returns Promise.
Await => .then
Error Handling => try catch 

Syntax: async function fnName() {
    await fetch(url)
}
