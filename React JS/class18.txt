Things about basics:

Data types => 

String : "Hello world"
number : 5
Boolean : True/False
null : Null
Undefined : Undefined
Object : {}
    Key value pair.
Array : []
    Collection of values or different datatype

For & ForEach => 

For: Here we give to give the value  for the loop
ForEach: (It works in Array)
It will automaticly loop itself througt out the Array form start of the index to the end of the index.

.map: It will return value in array

...Spread Operator
This we use in array.

...Rest Operator
This we use in function parameter.

Async/Await => means the function is now async so await some functions.

Import & Export => Means you can export 1 JS file and can import that in another JS file.
