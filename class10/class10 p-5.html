        <p>Honda CBR 650r</p>
        <p class="content">            
            The 2022 Honda CBR650R has been launched today at Rs 9,35,427 (ex-showroom, Haryana), making it a
            significant Rs
            47,427 more expensive than before. The 2021 CBR650R was launched at Rs 8.88 lakh in March 2021. <br>

            The CBR will continue to be a CKD, and the only changes associated with this update are to the graphics
            schemes
            of the two colour options. The colour names – Grand Prix Red and Matte Gunpowder Black Metallic – are the
            same
            as before, but the stickers and graphics have been tweaked. The red option now features black highlights on
            its
            side fairings compared to the earlier white, while the black option has received some neat contrasting
            orange
            highlights.<br>

            Aside from this, there are no mechanical changes, and the bike continues to use a 649cc inline-four cylinder
            engine producing 87hp at 12,000rpm and 57.5Nm at 8,500rpm.<br>

            With this price hike, what was already a pretty expensive motorcycle has now been priced even further out of
            reach, especially when compared to another faired 650cc sportsbike like the Ninja 650 (Rs 6.68 lakh
            ex-showroom,
            Delhi) or another entry-level inline-four cylinder machine like the larger, more powerful Kawasaki Z900 (Rs
            8.50
            lakh ex-showroom, Delhi)
