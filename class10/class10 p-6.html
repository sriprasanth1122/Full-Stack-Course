        <h4>Sample Paragraph to test the Fixed property</h4>
        <p style="font-size:20px;">
            The scene is total chaos: a woman and all her purse's contents in middair as she trips over a child's toy, a
            man hastily trying to gather his spilled laundry, a screaming child weaving through the crowd. Somewhere, in
            the midst of it all, is the person you've been looking for: wearing a red and white striped shirt, black
            rimmed glasses and a lopsided cap. There he is! There's Waldo.

            Many of us have fond memories of Waldo. But while he looms large in our imagination, our childhood searches
            for Waldo typically stayed pretty small – Waldo is a tiny person in the middle of lots of other tiny things.

            And that's what this post is about: wee things. Specifically, the wee things that we see as part of
            graphics, maps, visualizations (wee things in space) as well as the wee things we experience as part of
            interactions, navigation, and usability (wee things in time). This means everything from sequences of small
            graphics that help us make comparisons, to tiny locator maps that help orient us within a larger graphic, to
            navigation icons that give hints about how we should make our way around a page.

            Waldo, and the eternal search for him, can actually tell us quite a lot about design. In many ways, Waldo is
            a great example of what NOT to do when using wee things in your own work. So with Waldo as our anti-hero,
            let's take a look at how people read and interpret small visual forms, why tiny details can be hugely
            useful, and what principles we can apply to make all these little images and moments work for us as
            designers.

            Wee Things In Space
            Probably the most immediate definition of wee things are things that are physically small: little things on
            a page. We see these all the time in news graphics, and we're probably familiar with some of their forms:
            small multiples, sparklines, icons, etc. I'll go into more details about all of these.

            These visual forms work because they serve as extensions of our mind – they are cognitive tools that
            complement our own mental abilities. They do this by recording information for us to make use of later,
            lending a hand to our (pretty terrible) working memories, helping us search and discover and recognize.
            We'll take a look at one task in particular they are great at: letting us make comparisons.

            Make Comparisons

            Tiny sequences of graphics, also known as small multiples, are great ways to help our brains compare. They
            are so successful because we don’t have to rely on working memory – every bit of information is in front of
            us at the same time. This means that we can easily see changes, patterns or differences.

            Here are a bunch of examples of small multiples in the wild – maps and planets, first lady hair styles and
            telegraph signals, food trucks, fashion color trends and dressing appropriately for different climates, the
            distribution of deaths in the 1870’s and last but not least, Bill Murray’s hats.

            Drought’s Footprint, NY Times Kepler’s Tally of Planets, NY Times
            Strands of American History, NY Times (L) and The Conspicuous Telegraph, Scientific American (R)

            Trucks on a Roll, NY Magazine
            Front Row to Fashion Week, NY Times (L) and Weather people (R)


            Statistical Atlas of the Ninth Census (L) and Bill Murray Loves Hats, Derek Eads (R)

            The reason we can make comparisons so easily is because these small multiples take advantage of the built-in
            capabilities of our visual system. Specifically, something called preattentive processing.

            Preattentive Processing
            Table of Preattentive Features, Design for Information, Isabel Meirelles
            Technically, preattentive processing refers to "cognitive operations that can be performed prior to focusing
            attention on any particular region of an image.” But basically, it means the stuff you notice right away.
            Our brains aren't like scanners, they throw away most of what the eyes see. But they are good at perceiving
            simple visual features like color or shape or size, and in fact they do it amazingly fast without any
            conscious effort. That means we can tell immediately when a part of an image is different from the rest,
            without really having to focus on it. Our minds are really good at spotting one or two differences when
            everything else is the same.

            Like in this example, you can easily spot Waldo.


            It's easy to spot Waldo surrounded by his arch nemesis, Odlaw.

            Or in this example, right? This is not hard.

            Zen Version of Where's Waldo, Dan Piraro
            But obviously, this is not where Waldo typically hangs out! Where he goes, I can't find him at a glance, and
            I need to spend a lot of time and actual effort. Our experiences with Waldo are usually something more like
            this:


            A few years ago a group of MIT researchers actually studied what happened when people saw a scene like this.
            They used eye tracking devices to look at how people go about finding Waldo. This is what happens on a
            typical search:

            Statistical patterns of visual search for hidden objects, Scientific Reports
            Those jagged lines are the path of the eye as it hunts for Waldo (ending in success at the red dot). As you
            can probably tell, the process is far from straightforward.

            So, Waldo basically thwarts our preattentive processing. Instead, he forces us to use our attentive
            processing: the conscious, slow, sequential process that lets us focus on one thing at a time. This
            "spotlight" of attention might be good at letting us concentrate, but it makes us pretty bad at spotting
            Waldo. We have such a hard time seeing him (despite the fact that he's right there in plain sight) because
            he doesn’t stand out in any clear way, color or size or orientation.

            And obviously there are reasons for why Waldo doesn't stand out – he is purposely hard to find because his
            surroundings were constructed to hide him. But in general, we don’t want our graphics or data visualizations
            to be this much work to understand. If someone had to search that hard to read the information in a chart or
            graphic, it would be a failure. So if you're in the business of displaying data, avoid the Waldo strategy.

            Instead, take advantage of those preattentive features! In this graphic from ProPublica, the use of color
            draws your eyes to specific lines of red text.The grey lines are government claims about the succeses and
            results of the CIA's drone program. The red lines are the official statements that it doesn't exist (or
            rather, the government can neither confirm nor deny). The graphic uses the preattentive feature of color to
            call out these contradictions.
